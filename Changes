=head2 Changes in Sys::SigAction 0.07  09 Oct 2006

Version 0.06 broke in perl < 5.8.2... (who uses that any more!!!)
Well someone does... at least on RedHat... I did (do) claim backwards
compatibility... So I fixed it right this time, by checking the perl 
version before called the safe accessor on the POSIX::SigAction object.

Still no good test for safe mode... be prepared to send me a test
if you think safe signal handling is broken... for sure I could
not get it to work the way I think it should with with deferred 
signals.


=head2 Changes in Sys::SigAction 0.06  25 June 2006

Fix setting of SAFE flag in POSIX::sigaction.  In response
to CPAN bug: http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19916
Thanks to Steve Purk?, for point this out.

This required NOT setting safe=>1 (changing to to safe=>0)
in t/attrs.t and the the dbd-oracle test script.

A new test for safe=>1 needs to be developed, which explicitly tests
deferred signal handling.  I would welcome such a contribution.

Modify forever() in timeout.t so just loop instead of trying

returns an error on some platforms or test environments
